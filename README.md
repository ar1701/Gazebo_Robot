# Gazebo_Robot

## Overview

This repository contains a Gazebo simulation of a mobile robot designed to interact in a simulated environment. The project demonstrates the integration of robot modeling, simulation, and control using Gazebo and ROS (Robot Operating System).

## Demo

- **complete_robot.pdf**: PDF version of the robot's TF tree.
- **mobile_robot.gif**: Animated demonstration of the robot in action.

## Documentation

### Transform (TF) Tree

The robot's TF tree illustrates the relationship between different coordinate frames of the robot. This is crucial for understanding the robot's kinematics and sensor data interpretation.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ar1701/Gazebo_Robot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd Gazebo_Robot
   ```

3. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

4. **Source the setup file**:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

5. **Launch the simulation**:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch <launch_file>
   ```

   Replace `<launch_file>` with the appropriate launch file name.
